# Lesson 2: Collaborative Git

## Objectives
Fellows will be able to...
* Understand GitHub as a tool for collaboration and as remote host of git repositories.
* Understand GitHub as a social media platform for career development.
* Create a branch through the Github GUI and the CLI.
* Fork a repository.
* Create a pull request.
* Resolve merge conflicts through the Github GUI and CLI.

## Morning Warmup Questions (Be prepared for one of these questions to be presented at the beginning of lecture)
1. What is a branch? How is it similar/different to a clone or a fork?
2. What is a Pull Request (PR)? When in the Git/Github Workflow is a PR made?

### Optional Learning
So far, we've been working with Git and GitHub to improve our workflow as solo developers. Git(Hub) really shines as a tool for collaborative development. Explore the resources below to learn more about _branching_ and _merging_, the two concepts that GitHub collaborations rests upon.
* [Chapter 3: Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) in Pro Git book.
* [Understanding Git Merge Conflicts](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts)

#### Extend Your Learning
* Git branching and merging is one of the most complicated topics to conceptualize. The Coding Train does a pretty good jobs breaking down all sorts of git topics explaining them from the perspective of GUI and CLI.
