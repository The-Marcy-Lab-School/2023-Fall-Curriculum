## Design a Grocery List

Requirements:
* An Array of `grocery` Objects
* Each `grocery` Object should have a `name`, `quantity`, and `price` (in dollars)
* The Array should have at least 5 of these objects
* Aim to have a variety of values for each property across the `grocery` Objects (don't make them all have the same quantities, price, etc...)


## Find out information about the list

* Get the total price of the grocery list
* Add a `.purchased` property to each object with a default value of `false`
* Get all items with quantity of exactly 1
* Determine if you have any grocery items that have a price below `10`
