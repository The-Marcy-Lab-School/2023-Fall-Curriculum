# Unit 1: HTML5/CSS3 Foundations

> HTML is how we create a website with text, images, and links.
> CSS is how we style it!

### Learning Objectives

By the end of Unit 1, Fellows will be able toâ€¦

- Build a responsive, multi-page website where each HTML page has links to other HTML pages
- Master semantic HTML tags and CSS Selectors (especially classes and IDs)
- Use design tools (like Figma) to plan websites, build wireframes and create mock-ups
- **Plan out their approach before coding**
- Reinforce the git principles they learned in the last unit by working in pairs for Pair Programming labs and groups for Project Week!

### **Unit 1 Project Week**

Technical units at the Marcy Lab School end in a Unit Assessment, a Project Week, or both! Unit 1 will culminate in [F22: Unit 1 Project Week](https://www.notion.so/F22-Unit-1-Project-Week-a431d91ffb4b45189cc1443e140944b5) where the fellows will work in groups of 3 (no less than 2 and no more than 4) to build a responsive, multi-page website. They are encouraged to use a CSS library rather than building out their CSS from scratch.

### Code a little, test a little

- Preview my code > Pop out into a new tab.
- Make changes.
- Save code.
- Make a prediction - what change to I expect to see?
- Refresh the preview - did it turn out the way I expected?
- Learn!
